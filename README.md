# Self-Driving-RC-Car

This was one of the first robotics projects I made in junior high. As the "hello world" of robotics, I felt it necessary to turn an old remote controlled (RC) car into a basic autonomous vehicle. I mounted an Arduino Uno and a ultrasonic sensor on the chassis of the car, and wrote this program so that it could detect and navigate around objects.
